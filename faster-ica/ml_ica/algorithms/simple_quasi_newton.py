    '''
    Simple quasi-Newton algorithm.
    Highly inspired by:

    M. Zibulevsky, "Blind source separation with relative newton method"

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array, shape (N, T)
        Matrix containing the signals that have to be unmixed. N is the
        number of signals, T is the number of samples. X has to be centered

    max_iter : int
        Maximal number of iterations for the algorithm

    tol : float
        tolerance for the stopping criterion. Iterations stop when the norm
        of the gradient gets smaller than tol.

    precon : 1 or 2
        Chooses which Hessian approximation is used.
        1 -> H1
        2 -> H2
        H2 is more costly to compute but can greatly accelerate convergence
        (See the paper for details).

    lambda_min : float
        Constant used to regularize the Hessian approximations. The
        eigenvalues of the approximation that are below lambda_min are
        shifted to lambda_min.

    ls_tries : int
        Number of tries allowed for the backtracking line-search. When that
        number is exceeded, the direction is thrown away and the gradient
        is used instead.

    verbose : 0, 1 or 2
        Verbose level. 0: No verbose. 1: One line verbose. 2: Detailed verbose

    callback : None or function
        Optional function run at each iteration on all the local variables.

    Returns
    -------
    Y : array, shape (N, T)
        The estimated source matrix

    W : array, shape (N, N)
        The estimated unmixing matrix, such that Y = WX.
